## 🧭 About Me

I’m a passionate cybersecurity learner with 6 years of continuous exploration in areas like ethical hacking, network security, and secure programming. While I don’t consider myself a professional yet, I’ve built hands-on skills through self-study, small personal projects, CTFs, and open-source tools.

My goal is to keep improving, contribute to meaningful projects, and eventually become a skilled cybersecurity analyst or penetration tester.
